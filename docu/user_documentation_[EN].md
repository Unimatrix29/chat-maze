# Chat Maze: User Documentation [EN]

[Link to build (TODO)]()

### Before Playing

Go to the `../chat-leap/data` directory and create a file called **config.json**. This file must contain the following and the only one necessary line for connecting to OpenAI's API. Replace **YOUR API KEY** with your actual API key leaving it withing double quotation marks `""`:
```
    {
        "api_key" : "YOUR API KEY"
    }
```

### How to play

To start the game, go to the `../Chat Maze` directory and start `Chat Maze.exe` file.

_Note: Chat Maze **doesn't require** any administrator's permissions or other serious things to run, otherwise you might've downloaded something dangerous!_

As the game starts you'll see a welcome message which give you a brief guide, what Chat Maze is about. Basically, you have to help various characters to escape mazes they're captured in by giving them a direction to walk along. Some of these characters are pretty easy to get along with, others are quite tricky to communicate. Have fun encountering all of them :3

Here are some useful utility commands you may need:
- `/commands` - to see a list of all commands.
- `/help` - to get help with your current level.
- `/exit` - to close the game.
